## question

# Credit Card Generator

Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update after form submission
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
    - Any input field is empty
    - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
